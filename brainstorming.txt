- Shall run on Linux and Windows
    - take care about / vs \
    - Note: all compilers I know so far support Unix path names also on
      Windows, but not vice versa.
      Example:
        o #include <sys/syscall.h> also works on Windows
      but
        o #include <sys\syscall.h> fails on Linux
    --> use Unix path internally if required


- Shall support @lastreview to keep track on which files are reviewed.
    - hash over file _AFTER_ updating review comments to detect if
      file was modified after adding the @lastreview tag.
    - update hash if lastreview date got updated or a keyword (tbd) is used - tbd

- Allow configuration to be either stored within the project which is
  reviewed (i.e. within the git repository) or outside the project.
	- option for future update
- Allow database directory to be either part of the project or stored
  outside the project.
	- option for future update
- Allow report directory to be either part of the project or stored
  outside the project.
	- option for future update
- Storage place for configuration, database and report managed
  independently via command line option.
	- option for future update

- Add field for name who reported an issue.
	- tbd

Topics to consider
------------------

- What happens if a file is removed?
	- all open IDs will be closed - should be no problem
- What happens if a file is renamed?
	- does not matter - review minder works ID dependant, not file name dependant - expecting unique IDs for each review item
- Shall languages using other comment style than C/C++ be supported?
	- yes, but for a future version

Software design
---------------

- Python module to handle configuration
- hodea-rl-parse    # update review and @lastreview data base
- hodea-rl-gen-html # generate html report
- hodea-rl-gen-pdf  # generate pdf report
- hodea-rl-info     # show info about the review status

Command line options:
-t, --template file     # generate template configuration file
-c, --config file       # configuration file to read
-b, --database_dir path # path to the directory holding the review database
-r, --report_dir        # path to the report output directory
-f, --ofile             # output file name for the report
-v, --version           # print version information

hodea-rl-info
-------------

- prints information about the status of the review to the console (stdout).
- used at command line.

usage: hodea-rl-info [options] [file]

Command line options in addition to the above:

-m, --modified  # list files modified since last review, including the
                # date of last review.
-d, --date file # print the review or creation date of the given file
                # together with its filename.

Without options it should give an overview on all files: unreviewed,
reviewed and modified science last review.

Example:

$ hodea-rl-info

Shall print:

@{yyyy-mm-dd} main.c    N
@{yyyy-mm-dd} foo.c     R
@{yyyy-mm-dd} bar.c     M

With N for new, R for reviewed, and M for modified science review.
yyyy-mm-dd is the date of the last review, or the creation date of the
file as provided by the file system.

The option -d shall function is interface to git.

Example:

$ hodea-rl-info -d bar.c

shall print:

@{yyyy-mm-dd} bar.c

This can be used with git to show the differences of that file since this
date:

$ git diff `hodea-rl-info -d bar.c`
